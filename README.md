**Chronicle** is an XML-based system for organising teachers' lesson plans. Lesson plans are written in an XML format, and can then be viewed or reorganised.

## The Chronicle File Format
**Chronicle**'s files are typically given the file extension `*.xmc` (although any extension can be used) and are written in an XML-based format as specified below.

A **Chronicle** file begins with and 'XML declaration', which should be

    <?xml version="1.0"?>

This simply identifies the file as written in an XML-based format.
